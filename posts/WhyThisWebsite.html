			<h2 class="centered">Why This Website?</h2>
			<p>This is probably my 7th website? And when I mean website, I mean a website which I was prepared to call my <i> ultimate final website that I will keep updating for years to come!</i> Fortunately, I was wrong every time. Those websites were crap. The posts were not good, the programming behind them was nonexistent and I had no clue what I was doing.</p>

			<p> I still have no clue what I'm doing and the posts on here will not be the best written stuff you'll come across in the internet. However, this website is still <i>different.</i> It's different in the fact that I quite enjoy programming for the web now and that I will build this website from scratch using the vanilla basics: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>HTML</li>
				<li>CSS</li>
				<li>Javascript - will most likely be pure vanilla JS as well as some jQuery.</li>
				<li>PHP - <i>for now.</i></li>
			</ul>
			<p>I'm attempting to write this website using just libraries. No frameworks. I understand the advantages of using a framework but the purpose of this site is not just so I can have a platform to vent in, it's also so that I can learn a thing or two about web programming. Of course, I would have to learn some popular frameworks later on but not now.</p>
			<p>The website is open source at <span class="biggerfont"><a href="https://github.com/ichbinjon/ichbinjonwebsite" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github fa-1g" aria-hidden="true"></i> Github</a></span> just in case you'd like to <del>steal</del> look at it.</p>
